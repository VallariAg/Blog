# Distributed Systems

> A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. 

It is a collection of independent computers which communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal, together acting like a single system. 

Three characteristics:
1. Maintaining **concurrency** of computers 
2. Manage **independent failures** of computers
3. Overcome **lack of global clock** (computers have independent clocks)

## Storage



## Computation



## Messaging
