Don’t have time to write or draw a comic? But still want to **tell a story or express yourself** in a creative way? Make a zine! 

### What is a Zine? 
The word zine has come to represent a range of small-batch, DIY, “magazine-like” publications in terms of form and content.   

Zines are self made short-form magazine, where you can share your personal experience or thoughts in 8 small pages! 

Great thing about zines is that they’re whatever _you_ want them to be. You can make them digitally or on paper. It could be a silly doodle or a professional piece of art - all kinds of zines have a place in the world!  

### How do I make a zine?  
Making a zine is pretty easy! All you need is: 

1. One sheet of paper (A4 works!) 

 
2. Pencil  

 
3. A pair of scissors.  

 
Now, follow these steps to create a little zine booklet for yourself:

Now that you have zine booklet, you can unfold and draw your zine on the sheet. When you’re done, you can fold it back into a booklet. That’s it - your zine is ready! 

If you want to mass-produce your zines: write and draw into the zine at step 1 of the picture, and print copies of it. Then you can fold each of them up in a booklet like shown above.  

### What do I make a zine ABOUT? 
Short answer is … make it about whatever you want to express and share.  

Long answer… 

You can create a zine for: 

1. **Personal reflection**: share an experience and your thoughts 

 
2. **Fiction**: sketch out a scene or a short conversation between characters  

 
3. **Social commentary**: draw attention to an issue to call for action 

 
4. **Newsletter**: create a short-form newsletter or magazine about things that excite you 

 
Few days ago, I made **my first ever zine**! Here’s the concept I had for it: 

I went on my first international trip to Singapore and took a lot of pictures in hopes to make wallpapers or maybe even a montage video out of it. But sadly, my phone broke soon after coming back home (before I could backup my pictures). I did had a few pictures from what I shared with a few close friends and family, so I decided to use those pictures to document my trip in a zine!  

Because I wanted to add pictures, I decided to create a digital zine on Procreate. Check it out here:

I purchased one of her zine called “How Containers Works!” - it was educational _and_ fun to read.
