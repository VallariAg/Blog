Hello, I'm Vallari Agrawal! :)

I'm a third year computer science undergraduate student from Delhi (India).

<!-- ðŸ’» ðŸ¥‡ -->
I'm currently interning at **Ceph** as an [Outreachy Summer Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6934127809678176256/) of 2022. 
 Previously, I've interned at [Setu](https://setu.co/), a fin-tech Indian start-up based in Banglore. 
 
I've part of **Women TechMakers Engineering Fellow** scholarship program by **Talentsprint** and **Google**. Being part of this program has taught me to to write good, clean, readable code, learn how-to-learn, thinking in a team, etc. I've some of the best mentors here to guide me and the most amazing community of women of my age.

I've also received [Anita Borg's scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/) to attend **Grace Hopper Celebration**, the world's largest conference for women in STEM. 

I've build and worked on full-stack projects with React, Angular, NodeJS, Django, GraphQL, Docker. Checkout my projects on **[Github](https://github.com/VallariAg)**!

Illustrating and drawing is something I love to do in my free time, checkout my [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/VallariAg) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vallariag/) accounts.
