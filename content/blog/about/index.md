Hello, I'm Vallari Agrawal! :)

I'm currently working at **IBM (Ceph)** as a Software Engineer. 

### My work experience...

I joined Ceph IBM full-time in August 2023. Before that, I was an [Outreachy Summer Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6934127809678176256/) at Ceph in summer of 2022.

I have also worked as Backend Intern at [FamPay](https://fampay.in/) for six months (Nov 2022 - Apr 2023). Here, I was responsible for maintaining the affiliated-marketing service and worked on the KYC process of the product.

My very first internship was as a frontend engineering intern for six months at [Setu](https://setu.co/), a fin-tech Indian start-up based in Bangalore. Here, I worked with the most amazingly supportive and fun team, who appreciated my work and gave me ownership of projects.
 
I was also part of **Women TechMakers Engineering Fellow** scholarship program (Cohort 2) by **Talentsprint** and **Google**. Being part of this program has taught me to to write good, clean, readable code, learn how-to-learn, and thinking in a team. I've had some of the best mentors here to guide me and the most amazing community of women of my age working in the same industry.

I've also received [Anita Borg's scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/) to virtually attend **Grace Hopper Celebration**, the world's largest conference for women in STEM. 

### In my free time...

I have a personal blog/newsletter on Substack where I write (and doodle!) about topics I'm curious about: [vallariagrawal.substack.com](https://vallariagrawal.substack.com/)

You'll also find me sharing recommendations of videos, podcasts, and interesting articles on [Substack Notes](https://substack.com/@vallariag/notes) and [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/@vallari). 

**Digital Illustration**: I love illustrating (no matter how wacky my skills may be!), you can checkout some of my illustrations on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/vallariag/).

**Reading**: I enjoy consuming stories in many forms - books, movies, games. You can checkout my reading list on [goodreads](https://goodreads.com/vallariag). One of my favorite genre is science-fiction.

**Photography**: I like clicking pictures and sharing them on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@vallariag).
