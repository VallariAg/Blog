Open-source contribution is an excellent way to build skills and expand on one's current knowledge by working on large scale projects and interact with professionals. Contributing to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is an amazing opportunity to help in building open-source tools and becoming a part of a community.

One can get started by simply selecting an organization they wish to contribute, picking an issue on one of it's project, and trying to solve that. 

<!-- There are various open-source programs, Outreachy being one of them. Checkout details of all open-source programs [here](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Open-Source-Programs). -->

#### What is Outreachy?

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a 12+ week internship programs where contributors work with an open-source organization under the guidance of mentors.

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is another open-source internship program which works with similar projects and timeline as Outreachy.  Checkout details of all open-source programs [here](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Open-Source-Programs).

Outreachy supports people from underrepresented groups in tech by providing an opportunity to work with organizations participating in the program. It encourages members of a minority group to pave their way in the tech industry by providing mentorship to build technical skills and an invitation to an inclusive community with no room for systemic bias or discrimination.   

<!-- I was particularly interested to participate in this program because of shared values of compassion, community, optimism, growth, and change.  -->

With help of knowledge and opportunities I gain from my experience in Outreachy, I hope to encourage more women to join the tech community and help lessen the under-representation of women in tech for the next generation of students.      


#### What am I working on?

I'm interning at [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en/) with the Outreachy program, where I'm working on the project [Making Teuthology a better detective](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-may-2022-internship-round/communities/ceph/#making-teuthology-a-better-detective) to improve Ceph's teuthology logs. 

As I write this, my first week of the internship is in progress and I'm excited to understand more about how teuthology works, working on a solution for the project, and meeting with mentors and team members.
